Absolutely! Here’s a clear, compartmentalized roadmap for developing your scientific computing–oriented, C++-like statically typed OO language and compiler.

***

## Compiler Project Roadmap

### 1. **Language Specification (Design Phase)**
- Finalize syntax and semantic rules (based on your summary).
- Write and maintain a language reference document (for types, syntax, operators, etc.).
- Design a small sample program set to use for tests/examples.

***

### 2. **Scaffolding and Tools**
- Choose project structure and build tools (OCaml + Dune recommended).
- Set up the initial repository (folders for source, tests, documentation).
- Build minimal infrastructure (simple Readme, build system setup).

***

### 3. **Lexical Analysis (Lexer/Tokenizer)**
- Define the full set of tokens (keywords, literals, operators, identifiers, etc.).
- Write the lexer: convert input source text into a stream of tokens.
- Implement tests for individual tokens and error cases.

***

### 4. **Parsing**
- Define the grammar (as EBNF or similar).
- Build the parser to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the token stream.
- Add error reporting for syntax mistakes.
- Test: Parse various correct and incorrect input examples.

***

### 5. **Semantic Analysis & Type Checking**
- Walk the AST to:
  - Build symbol tables for identifiers, types, scopes.
  - Check types and enforce rules (signedness, precision, object-oriented correctness, etc.).
- Implement error messages for type issues (e.g., type mismatch, undeclared identifier).
- Test: Type-check valid/invalid programs.

***

### 6. **Intermediate Representation (IR) (optional but recommended)**
- Design a simple IR for analysis or later code generation passes (facilitates optimizations and backend changes).
- Translate the AST into IR.

***

### 7. **Code Generation / Execution Backend**
- Choose target (e.g., C, LLVM IR, custom VM, or interpreter in OCaml).
- Implement code generator to emit code from IR or AST.
- Support for control flow, arithmetic, functions, classes, arrays, etc.
- Basic I/O and runtime features.

***

### 8. **Runtime & Standard Library**
- Implement runtime features (memory management, error handling, array/complex math, etc.).
- Ship with essential standard library components: math, stats, array/matrix, I/O, etc.

***

### 9. **Advanced Features**
- Parallelism/multithreading support.
- Optimizations and performance improvements.
- Extensibility hooks (e.g., plugins, FFI/interop).

***

### 10. **Testing, Examples, and Documentation**
- Build extensive test suite (unit, integration, regression).
- Write detailed documentation and language/tutorial guides.
- Create example scientific programs using your language.

***

### 11. **Visualization & Data Formats**
- Integrate with plotting/data export libraries.
- Support common scientific data formats (CSV, HDF5, etc.).

***

## How to Proceed Piece by Piece

Each “phase” above can be made into its own OCaml module or set of modules.  
- We can tackle each step in order (e.g., start with a basic lexer, once working, proceed to parser, etc.).
- When you’re ready to work on a specific piece (say, lexer), tell me, and I’ll help you design, code, and test it!  
- Each part is well-isolated so you can test independently before moving on.

Let me know which step you’d like to begin with, or if you’d like a more detailed task breakdown for a particular phase!
